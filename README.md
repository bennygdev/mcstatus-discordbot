Discord bot with basic functionalities which checks the minecraft server's online status, ping and player list.
<br>
If you want to use this bot, you will need to add a .env file and add the following:
<br>
```
TOKEN = YOUR BOT TOKEN
GUILD_ID = SERVER ID
CLIENT_ID = BOT ID
```

Make sure to run the command file first to initalise the slash commands first before running the index file. Also make sure to replace the 3 const variables with your information. Below for reference:
<br>
```
const serverIP = "YOUR SERVER IP";
const serverPort = YOUR SERVER PORT;
const minecraftUsername = "YOUR MINECRAFT USERNAME";
```
